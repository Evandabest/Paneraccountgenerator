Hi, this is my first project that I have worked on and that has a practical use for me.
In this program, I used the framework Selenium which is used for web automation. 
For this program you will need to make sure that you have pip installed the selenium module
and the undected chrome webdriver. The practical use of this program is that Panera has an
in app deal where you can get a free pastry with a purchase. I use this deal to grab a 
bite here and there. What I don't like is the fact that I have to make a new account
everytime. So I just decided to make an automated bot that makes accounts for me.
